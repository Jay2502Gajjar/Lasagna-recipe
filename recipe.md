Just like when making classic lasagna, the method for our recipe is pretty simple. Here’s an overview of how to make our vegetable lasagna (the full recipe is below):

Cook your lasagna noodles OR skip this step and use no-boil noodles. Even though we use regular lasagna noodles in our video, I actually prefer the texture of no-boil noodles and bonus, it’s easier!


Make the simple tomato sauce, which takes about 20 minutes. If you’re going to be short on time, the sauce can be made up to three days in advance.


Combine ricotta cheese, egg, and a bit of salt together. Choose a high quality ricotta for this. Unfortunately quite a few brands miss the mark when it comes to great tasting ricotta. I like BelGioioso Ricotta con Latte Whole Milk, Sorrento, and if I can find it, freshly made ricotta from our local cheese shop.


Assemble the lasagna by layering the vegetable sauce, noodles, the ricotta mixture, and shredded cheese.


The lasagna bakes in the oven for about 35 minutes. I like to bake it covered for 20 minutes, and then uncover it so the top and cheese get some color.


The vegetable sauce takes about 20 minutes and can be made up to 3 days in advance.


Bake the lasagna covered for 20 minutes, and then uncover and continue to bake until done.
