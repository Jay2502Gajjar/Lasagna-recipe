You will need 4 to 5 cups of chopped vegetables to make this meatless lasagna. Here are some suggestions for vegetables you can use:

Zucchini and/or yellow summer squash, chopped
Mushrooms, chopped or torn into small pieces
Spinach, kale or other greens
Winter squash like butternut or delicata squash would be excellent for a fall-inspired lasagna. I’d peel and cube them.
Carrots, chopped or shredded
Bell peppers, fresh or roasted (I love adding roasted red peppers)
Eggplant that’s been cut into cubes
